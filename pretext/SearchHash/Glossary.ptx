                        <p>search method in which one repeatedly divides a sorted data structure in
                            half and determines if the item is in one half of it until the item is
                            found or deemed not in the data.</p>

                        <p>a method for constructing a hash function by dividing the item into
                            equally sized pieces and then adding the pieces together to get a hash
                            value. The value is then divided by the size of the hash table and the
                            remainder becomes the slot for that item.</p>
